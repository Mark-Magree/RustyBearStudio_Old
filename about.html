	<h2>About Cristen Magree</h2>
	<p>I live in the beautiful Ohio foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, with my husband, Mark, who is himself a photographer. It is a landscape that has inspired much of my work. Throughout my academic career I have studied art history, cartooning, FX makeup and acrylic painting. I have participated in local art and nature shows, have artwork displayed at The Portage Hill Gallery in Chautauqua, NY and have participated in many charity events. I continue to evolve my work and extend my skills and experience into the art and networking communities.</p>

	<h2>The story of Rusty Bear</h2>
	<p>Rusty came into our world on a chilly fall day. Peering through our front porch window, he sat there for an entire week just watching us move about the house. He'd stare as our two current cats stared back. One day the door was left open and he decided that would be the perfect time to waddle on in and make himself at home. He became ours that day and we became his.
	Despite the obvious indications of a hard life on the streets (frost bitten ears, damaged vocal cords, no teeth), he was the most loving creature. If you didn't like cats,  you liked Rusty.</p>
	<p>As soon as he'd wake up from sleeping and realized someone had come into the room, he'd greet us with little chirps and come waddling over for some love. Pull him into your lap and he'd stay there for hours, nuzzling your nose, bumping your head, falling asleep. He was truly one of the sweetest animals I have ever come across and I doubt that I will find another like him. He was my baby boy, my cuddle bug. Unfortunately our little love bug passed away in February of 2013.</p>
	<p>SO, in an attempt to heal and to help his memory live on, he has become the namesake of my company and will forever be in the hearts of those he has touched. </p>
